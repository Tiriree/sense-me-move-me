# Syllabus - Work in Progress

- Spring 2017, Mondays, 12:10-3:05PM in Room 50

###Course Structure | [See introductory description below.](#course-description)
The course is organized around 3 parameters of movement, 3 ways of understanding motion: 
   1. Pathways
   2. Form
   3. Space 
   
Assignments will consist of 1-2 small studies exploring each topic that culminate in a final project and showing.

Because course topics are organized around movement concepts, technical topics will be introduced and built upon week to week. 
- What do cameras see? RGB v. IR
- Kinect Skeletons
- "Traditional" CV: Blob, Contours and Faces
- Kinect Depth Maps
- Gravity-based motion capture suits

"Soft Skills" we will practice:
- Sketching movement ideas.
- Defining rule sets for movement.
- Deconstructing movement into parameters for code.
- Extracting movement ideas from code.
- Designing "conversational" interactions in code.

# Course Description
A re-working of Choreographic Interventions (Spring 2016), this class is intended for anyone interested in using sensing technologies and movement to create interactive experiences.

We are surrounded by interfaces where swipes and taps control elements on a screen. Less familiar are systems designed to compel us to move in new and unexpected ways. How do you make someone feel soft inside? How do you shake an entire room? How do you orchestrate duets between strangers?

Every class, we will move in order to push the boundaries of how you think you’re capable of moving while experimenting with computational methods for building interactions that excite our curiosity, engage our whole body and provide an outlet for expression through movement.

We will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the various motion-tracking technologies, from “traditional computer vision” (blobs, contours, faces) to “new CV” (Kinect skeletons and 3D depth maps) to motion capture suits. What is the gap between what we can see and feel in our bodies as we move (strength, softness, contortion) and what a computer can sense and interpret (locations, contours, skeletons, velocity, acceleration)?

Pre-requisites: Introduction to Computational Media or its equivalent.

##Grading
- 40% for showing up (on time!) and participating with curiosity and enthusiasm.
- 10% for each topic study.
- 20% for the final project.
- More than 2 unexcused absences qualifies you for a failure.
